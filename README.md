a) Assuming you are using Dbeaver as well, you can connect to the database using the following settings:

- Host: localhost

- Port: 5432

- Database: postgres

- Username: postgres

- Password: secret


b) Alternatively, if you are not using DBeaver or any application to set up the connection, you can access the database using the following code in Anaconda/command prompt:

$ docker exec -it pg psql -U postgres

Thereafter, you can use the DDL statements found in Section2.sql to create and alter the desired tables.
